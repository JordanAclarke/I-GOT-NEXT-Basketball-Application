# I-Got-Next !!

For Project Three, I created a basketball meetup app. This app will allow players to post a court they're going to play at. Players can also see other current courts and add themself to that court. The players will display at the bottom of the court page so that other players can see who's going on that day.

## Version 2
For Version 2, I would like to implement a third party weather api, sport database, and google maps. I want the player to see the exact location on the map and know the projected weather for that day. I would also like to add more react-bootstrap styling and some material-ui to enhance user experience.
